    "# Variational Quantum Eigensolver\n",
    "BLABLA introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a common method in quantum computation to estimate eigenvalues of some unitary operator corresponding to an eigenvector. It has been shown to provide an exponential speed-up over current classical algorithms for determining ground state energies of quantum systems. However, to get good accuracy a long coherent evolution has to be performed, and as engineers struggle to achieve acceptable coherence times we can look for other methods better suited for near-term quantum computers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), unlike QPE, requires only a short coherent evolution. It is a hybrid algorithm utilizing both quantum and classical computers. In other words, this algorithm is specifically aimed at near-term quantum computers, and only requires state preparation and measurement of Pauli operators which is done in polynomial time. Can implement wave function ansätzes that are exponentially costly on classical computers. VQE is resistant to gate noise in some cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "Assume we have an initial state of qubits $\\ket{\\Phi}$, we want to prepare our trial ground-state stationary wave function $\\ket{\\Psi(\\theta)}$, dependent on some set of variables $\\theta$, by an action of a suitable unitary operator $\\hat{U}(\\theta)$.\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\ket{\\Psi} = \\hat{U}\\ket{\\Phi}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "By variationally optimizing $\\hat{U}$ we can find estimates to the ground state energy\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\frac{\\bra{\\Psi}H \\ket{\\Psi}}{\\bra{\\Psi}\\ket{\\Psi}} \\leq E_0\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "This is commonly known as the variational method. To implement this, we divide our algorithm into two subroutines; one quantum and one classical. The quantum subroutine prepares our state followed by multiple measurements of the expectation value in an appropriate basis. The classical subroutine will optimize the expectation value, with gradient descent or such, by varying the parameters. The process is then repeated.\n"
